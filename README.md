# Gerold
This is the code lineage for my PS2 tank, randomly named, Gerold.  
This is my first time using Github, so I have no idea if however I use this is right.
I tried to make my code readable, but due to the fact I am self taught, you may have a stroke.

I used PS2X as my library for my controller so I can remotely control the arduino, here is the github:
https://github.com/simondlevy/PS2X_lib/blob/master/PS2X_lib.h

Key:
  Mk2 is D-pad,
  Mk3 is Tankdrive (Joysticks)
